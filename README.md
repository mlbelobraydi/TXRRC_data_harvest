# TXRRC_data_harvest
Script for downloading and organizing oil and gas well data from the Texas Railroad Commission

This is currently in development. This is my first public repository, so I'm sure it will take a bit to get things organized an usable, so bear with me.

The goal is to provide scripts to help download and organize the oil and gas well data provided publicly from the Texas Railroad Commission (TXRRC).

The current development is happening in the https://github.com/mlbelobraydi/TXRRC_data_harvest/blob/master/WorkingFileForTesting.py section for those following along.
